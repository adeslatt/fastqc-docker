# fastqc-docker
Build a Container for bioconda fastqc

Steps to build this docker container.
1. Look up on [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) the tool you wish to install
2. create an `environment.yml` file either manually or automatically
3. Use the template `Dockerfile` modifying if necessary (in our case we have no custom files for the `src` directory so we do not use that)
4. Build the Docker Image
5. Set up GitHub Actions

To edit the files:
1. Use a simple editor (Text Edit on Mac is fine) - we want to be cautious about unseen characters
2. Use emacs (can be installed with conda)
```bash
conda install -c conda forge emacs
